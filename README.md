# Twitter BOT Detector 

A binnary classifier to help BOT detection on twitter. This model only outputs a score [0-1000], where 0 means very low probability of the account being a BOT and 1000 represents the highest probability of an account being a BOT. 
We only use profile-based features in this project, such as followers count, some flags like "has image?" and others.
